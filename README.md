# to-do-list

# Key Learning Areas

* Angular JS
* Node
* Heroku

An exercise using Angular JS to create a To-Do List. 
I was able to complete this task and incorporate some extra functionality using various Angular modules:

* Local storage means tasks are stored in each users browser.
* Angular resource module used to call Flixsta API and assign a relevant picture to each item.
* Angular ui-sortable allows a user to drag and drop items and sort in order of priority.

# Future Improvements

* More work on styling
* Make page responisve
* Allow users to edit items
